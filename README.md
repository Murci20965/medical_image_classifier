## ðŸ“Š Model Performance
The model was trained for 10 epochs, achieving a final validation accuracy of **87.50%**. On the unseen test set, the model's performance was evaluated as follows:

- **Overall Accuracy**: **82.85%**
- **Key Metrics for Pneumonia Class**:
  - **Precision**: 0.91 (Of all the images predicted as "Pneumonia", 91% were correct.)
  - **Recall**: 0.96 (The model correctly identified 96% of all actual "Pneumonia" cases.)
  - **F1-Score**: 0.88 (A balanced measure of precision and recall.)

| Class     | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| NORMAL    | 0.91      | 0.60   | 0.72     | 234     |
| PNEUMONIA | 0.80      | 0.96   | 0.88     | 390     |
| **Total** | **0.84** | **0.83** | **0.82** | **624** |

## Project Architecture
The project follows a modular structure to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Murci20965/medical_image_classifier.git](https://github.com/Murci20965/medical_image_classifier.git)
   cd medical_image_classifier
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   # For Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Dataset:**
   Download the dataset from the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and place the contents into the `data/raw/` directory. The final path should be `data/raw/chest_xray/`.

---
## Usage Guide

Ensure your virtual environment is active before running any commands.

### 1. Training the Model

To train the model from scratch, run the following command from the project's root directory. This will save a new, timestamped model file in the `models/` directory.

```bash
python -m src.train
```

### 2. Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the performance of the **latest** trained model on the unseen test set, run:

```bash
python -m src.evaluate
```

This will print a classification report to the console and save a confusion matrix plot to the `plots/` folder.

### 3. Running the Application (Local)

To run the application locally, you will need two separate terminals.

1. **Terminal 1: Start the API Server**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```

   The API documentation will be available at `http://12-7.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

2. **Terminal 2: Start the Gradio UI**

   ```bash
   python ui/interface.py
   ```

   Open the local URL provided in the terminal to access the web interface.

### 4. Running with Docker

Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t medical-image-classifier .
   ```

2. **Run the container:**

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --name medical-app medical-image-classifier
   ```

   The API will be running inside the container and accessible at `http://localhost:8000`. You can then start the Gradio UI locally (Step 3B) to interact with it.

---
## Testing

To run the automated unit tests and ensure the application's core logic is working correctly, use the following command:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

---
## Deployment

This application is fully containerized and ready for deployment. The `Dockerfile` can be used to deploy the application to any cloud service that supports containers, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
